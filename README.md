![banner](readme/img/banner.png)

This repository is directed to a full stack personal project, where I'll develop the Frontend with React and consume the Backend API developed with Spring Boot.
<br/>In addiction to do a few more things with this project, I'll do a Python automation script that will populate the Employees data with Selenium.

## Backend
The backend was developed with Spring Boot and Java 17, so after configuring the Java, open the "server" folder and start the Spring API.
<br/>You will have access to the API at `http://localhost:8080/`. Authentication isn't needed.

## Frontend
To run the frontend, you will need to run a React project located at the "client" folder su just run `npm install` and `npm start` at the client folder directory.

After running the command lines below, you can have access of this following pages at `http://localhost:3000/`:

### Post Page
There you can create a new employee.
